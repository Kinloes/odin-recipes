This is my first HTML project for the Odin Project.

What did I learn?

I figured out some of the issues I had with general structure and found out what to look for like missing closing carrots or putting text in the wrong spot.

This project also helped to solidify the knowledge I had accrued with the prior videos and courses the Odin Project went over. Now I'm confident that I could build a simple HTML webpage from scratch and have it work correctly.
